## Interactive Visualization of Sign Language using the Leap Motion.

This app aims at teaching the basics of sign language using the Leap Motion controller.

Built by Daisy Smith[http://github.com.daisymarie128] and I.

####This is still a work in progress.

At the moment, only the letters 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F' & 'I' are covered.
However, you may realise that they are not working properly due to a lack of time to make the tracking really accurate.

###TODO:

* Add more letters.
* Make the tracking more accurate.
* Add basic words.
